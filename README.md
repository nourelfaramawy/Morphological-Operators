# Morphological-Operators
**Project Title: Grayscale Morphological Operators**

**Description:**

The main aim of this assignment is to experiment with various Morphological operator applications applied to grayscale images. Morphological operators can be utilized with binary images, achieving various results. Hence, the aim of this assignment is to evaluate the performance of such operators in the grayscale domain. The following functions are required to be implemented:

1. **Dilation**: This operation involves expanding the boundaries of objects in an image.

2. **Erosion**: Erosion shrinks the boundaries of foreground objects in an image.

3. **Opening**: Opening is a morphological operation that involves performing an erosion operation followed by a dilation operation.

4. **Closing**: Closing is a morphological operation that involves performing a dilation operation followed by an erosion operation.

The following test scenarios are to be applied (on both binary and grayscale):

1. **Dilation**: Evaluate the dilation operation on grayscale images.

2. **Erosion**: Evaluate the erosion operation on grayscale images.

3. **Opening**: Test the opening operation on grayscale images.

4. **Closing**: Test the closing operation on grayscale images.

5. **Absolute subtraction of Dilation and Erosion**: Perform absolute subtraction between the results of dilation and erosion operations to observe the difference.

**Requirements:**

- Implement the specified morphological operations for grayscale images.
- Develop test scenarios for each operation to ensure correctness and performance evaluation.
- Provide clear documentation and comments for code readability.
- Consider edge cases and handle them appropriately.
- Optimize the algorithms for efficiency where possible.

**Expected Output:**

- Detailed implementation of each morphological operation with explanations.
- Test cases and results demonstrating the functionality of each operation.
- Performance evaluation and comparison between different operations.
- Discussion on the strengths and limitations of morphological operations in the grayscale domain.

**Additional Notes:**

- Feel free to expand on the project by experimenting with different kernel sizes, structuring elements, and image types.
- Encourage collaboration and contributions from others interested in image processing and computer vision.
